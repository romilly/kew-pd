# KEW-PD

## Knowledge Engineer's Workbench for Python Developers

A collection of tools designed for Python to improve
their productivity through the use
of generative AI applications like ChatGPT and Mistral.

## Prompt Engineering Workbench

The first tool is  PEW, a streamlit application that allows users to
select useful prompts, customise them, and submit them to a Generative AI Agent like ChatGPT.

## Installation

The App is still in pre-alpha state.
My next task is to remove as many local dependencies as I can.
I'll add installation instructions once that is done.
